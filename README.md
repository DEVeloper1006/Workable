# Workable

Have you ever felt extremely alone? I know most of us may have but it may have been even harder for some of our parents who lived in a non digital age. Some of whom may have had to travel great lengths even internationally to get to where they are and make huge sacrifices for the life you guys live today. To make this transition much easier and accessible, we have created an efficient and simple solution called "Workable." Essentially how this program works is that it asks the user a series of questions about who they are and their background coming into Canada. For instance, let's pretend you are traveling with a family of 4 coming into Canada and you are a doctor. Workable is able to utilize this information and find the best set of house locations that are close to areas such as grocery stores, community centres and professions that best suit your skill set. Which enables newcomers to Canada to have Workable transition as they adjust to their new lifestyle.
